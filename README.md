# FabricRoles
This repository contains materials related to Fabric roles, which are a way of defining and describing jobs that people work at on the Microsoft Fabric Platform. The Fabric Platform is a cloud-based service that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage applications using various technologies and frameworks. 

Fabric roles allow you to outline the skills, responsibilities, and tasks required for different types of jobs on the Fabric Platform, such as developer, tester, manager, etc. Some of the materials in this repository are:

A set of job descriptions for various Fabric roles, including the qualifications, expectations, and benefits of each role.

A presentation that shows how the organizational structure can evolve over time, based on the feedback, performance, and goals of the Fabric Platform team.
